              <p class="card-text">Wash your hands. First, wash up with soap and water so you don’t get bacteria into the cut and cause an infection. If you’re on the go, use hand sanitizer.
Stop the bleeding. Put pressure on the cut with a gauze pad or clean cloth. Keep the pressure on for a few minutes.
Clean the wound. Once you’ve stopped the bleeding, rinse the cut under cool running water or use a saline wound wash. Clean the area around the wound with soap and a wet washcloth. Don’t get soap in the cut, because it can irritate the skin. And don’t use hydrogen peroxide or iodine, which could irritate the cut.
Remove any dirt or debris. Use a pair of tweezers cleaned with alcohol to gently pick out any dirt, gravel, glass, or other material in the cut.

              <p class="card-text">Nosebleeds usually look a lot worse than they are. Most of the time you can stop the flow with a few simple steps:

Lean the head slightly forward, so blood doesn’t run down the throat.
With a tissue or washcloth, gently press the nostrils together to stop the bleeding.
Hold the nose for at least 5 minutes. Then check to see if the bleeding has stopped. If it hasn’t stopped, gently squeeze for another 10 minutes..</p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">For any animal bite, you may need an antibiotic to prevent infection. So it’s always a good idea to call your doctor, especially if you have medical conditions that weaken your immune system. Also, you should call your doctor or head to the emergency room if:

The bite was caused by an animal you don’t know, or by any wild animal like a raccoon, skunk, or bat. You may need a tetanus or rabies vaccine.
The bite is large, or it doesn’t stop bleeding after you’ve held pressure on it for 15 minutes. It may need to be closed with stitches.
You think the bite may have damaged a bone, tendons, or nerves, because you can’t bend or straighten the body part or you’ve lost feeling in it.
The wound is red, swollen, or oozing fluid.</p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">You can treat minor first-degree burns and small second-degree burns at home. Here’s what to do:

Place the burned area under running cool water for at least 5 minutes to reduce swelling.
Apply an antiseptic spray, antibiotic ointment, or aloe vera cream to soothe the area.
Loosely wrap a gauze bandage around the burn.
To relieve pain, take acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen..</p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">Treat the rash and itch at home with these steps:

Wash your skin. To get as much of the oil off as possible, clean your skin with soap and lukewarm water.
Wash everything. Clean anything the plant touched -- your clothes, gardening tools, even your pet. The oil can stick to these objects and cause a rash if you touch them again.
Bathe in oatmeal. Run a warm bath and add some colloidal oatmeal or baking soda to ease the itch. You can also apply a cool, wet washcloth to your skin.
Apply calamine or hydrocortisone cream. These products will also relieve the itch. If creams and lotions aren’t enough to soothe itchy skin, ask your doctor whether you should take an antihistamine or steroid medicine by mouth.
Don’t scratch! Though the rash might itch, resist the urge to scratch or pick at the blisters. You could get an infection.</p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">For a mild sprain or strain:

Rest the limb to give it a chance to heal.
Hold ice on the area for 20 minutes at a time, four to eight times a day, to bring down swelling. Don’t use heat -- it could make the area swell even more.
Wrap an elastic bandage or splint around the sprain or strain.
Put a pillow under the injured body part to keep it raised.
Take over-the-counter medicines such as ibuprofen to relieve the pain.
For a more severe sprain or strain, where there’s a lot of pain, swelling, and you have trouble moving around, see your doctor. You may need crutches or physical therapy.</p>
